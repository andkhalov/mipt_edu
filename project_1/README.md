# Project 1. Game: "Guess number" version with memory

New feature: algorithm save each guess and make a new value for high and low random range.
This advantage reduse mean quantity on guesses from 105 to 8.

### Project description    
Educational project witch was a part of the module 3 in SkillFactory Python course.

:arrow_up:[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)


### Case to solve:   
Guess the number guessed by the computer in the minimum number of attempts. Improove automatic guess function by minimal updates in code.

**Competition conditions:**  
- New algorythm must give maximum 20 attempts for one guessing round.

**Quality metrics**     
Results are assessed by the average number of attempts per 1000 repetitions

**What we practice**     
Learning to write good code in python, using Git and GitHub basic features, apply PEP8 into code.


### Brief info about data
All data in this progect generated radomly by NumPy

### Work stages  
1. Understanding task
2. Decomposing
3. Coding
4. Check
5. Write docs and README
6. Publish in GitHub
7. Send assigment

### Result:  

I wrote "if" conditions to check is a guess_number is greater or smaller than target number, and make two new variables: high and low.
After this upgrade I have a result: 8 stages of guessign in mean in the result of 1000 experiments.

### Conclusion:

Assigment is done propperly.
